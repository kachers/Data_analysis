No need trying to explain those data artefacts, just point them out. Basically, this is a creative task - the more you can find or get out of the given data the better. The task can take around 3h.

Please use Python (preferably Jupiter Notebook) or R (preferably R Markdown) or Excel to complete the test task. There is no strict format on how the task should be completed, but please note that it's preffered to see the way how you came up with those theories/conclusions.
